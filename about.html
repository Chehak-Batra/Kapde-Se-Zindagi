          <p>Addressing a real-time social problem of blanket distribution during the winter season where there are management issues regarding donors and seekers. <br><br> A warm house and healthy living are basic human needs, yet many in our country are devoid of these.
            With our project, we aim to create a management tool that can organize blanket donations in a more efficient and productive manner.
            
            We aim to draft a comprehensive documented response and create a website platform where people can input their needs along with urgency level and accordingly NGOs can be connected to ensure maximum blanket distribution.
            </p>
            <br>
          <p><b> Current Problem:</b> <br>
            We may have heard of many blanket drives where NGOs or groups of people randomly distribute blankets. There may be certain families receiving these blankets multiple times by different people and some families in need of them and not able to get them even once. So, there is a lack of management in needs and providings.
            </p>
            <br>
          <p><b> Our Idea:</b><br>
            We are trying to solve this problem by creating a common platform for donors and seekers. We will try to connect people who are in need of blankets and who are willing to donate so that blankets can be distributed with better management skills.
