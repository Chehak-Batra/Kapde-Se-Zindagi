        <h1>Why giving back to the world is important?</h1>
        <p>
            <b>1. There are mental health benefits </b>
            According to the Cleveland Clinic, research shows that giving has a positive impact on a person’s mental health. Giving of any kind – including volunteering your time or offering a monetary donation – activates the production of “feel-good” brain chemicals.
<br><br>
            <b> 2. There are physical health benefits</b>
            Studies link generosity to physical health benefits like lower blood pressure. The fact that generosity can lower stress is both a mental and physical benefit since stress is associated with many health problems.
<br><br>
           <b> 3. There are financial benefits</b>
            Most countries provide individuals with a tax write-off for donations. That process varies depending on where you’re from. 
<br><br>
           <b> 4. Organizations depend on donations</b>
            Of the millions of organizations out there, most depend on donations to keep the lights on. Without donations, these organizations wouldn’t be able to continue their work.
<br><br>
           <b> 5. Donations raise awareness </b>
            Organizations use donations for a variety of reasons, including expanding their reach. They can pay for things like social media campaigns and fundraising events, which lets them draw attention to the issues they’re focused on.
<br><br>
           <b> 6. Donations meet urgent needs </b>
            Donations help pay for emergency relief and see people through crises. That includes disasters like hurricanes, wildfires and Covid-19 pandemic where urgent help was needed in the form of PPE and oxygen kits.
<br><br>
           <b> 7. Donations also help build long-term solutions </b>
            Experts say that healthcare and education programs are essential. Giving to organizations committed to sustainable and effective actions help communities become self-sufficient.
<br><br>
           <b> 8. Even small donations make an impact </b>
            Smaller donations are often recurring amounts given each month. This consistency is important to organizations.
<br><br>
            <b> 9. Donating is contagious </b>
            When you donate to an organization, tell your friends and family why. They might feel encouraged to donate, too.
<br><br>
           <b> 10. Donating sets a good example for the next generation </b>
            Gen Z is the next generation of donors. There are trends that show Gen Z is very aware of the issues of today, and though they’ll have a harder time building wealth, they are committed to making the world better.
